'''
Schedulers determine how worker's queues get filled. They control which locations get scanned,
in what order, at what time. This allows further optimizations to be easily added, without
having to modify the existing overseer and worker thread code.

Schedulers will recieve:

queues - A list of queues for the workers they control. For now, this is a list containing a
            single queue.
status - A list of status dicts for the workers. Schedulers can use this information to make
            more intelligent scheduling decisions. Useful values include:
            - last_scan_date: unix timestamp of when the last scan was completed
            - location: [lat,lng,alt] of the last scan
args - The configuration arguments. This may not include all of the arguments, just ones that are
            relevant to this scheduler instance (eg. if multiple locations become supported, the args
            passed to the scheduler will only contain the parameters for the location it handles)

Schedulers must fill the queues with items to search.

Queue items are a list containing:
    [step, (latitude, longitude, altitude), appears_seconds, disappears_seconds)]
Where:
    - step is the step number. Used only for display purposes.
    - (latitude, longitude, altitude) is the location to be scanned.
    - appears_seconds is the unix timestamp of when the pokemon next appears
    - disappears_seconds is the unix timestamp of when the pokemon next disappears

    appears_seconds and disappears_seconds are used to skip scans that are too late, and wait for scans the
    worker is early for.  If a scheduler doesn't have a specific time a location needs to be scanned, it
    should set both to 0.

If implementing a new scheduler, place it before SchedulerFactory, and add it to __scheduler_classes
